# PIC16B---Project
I don't know if you can see a .idea folder, 
but that's probably because I use Pycharm as my default
text editor, and if I make changes, the folder will be
created. So no worry, and I believe it will only be 
created once. 

I create a webscraping.py file. We will put all our codes in this file at the end. 
But for now, we could use either form (notebook) to try our codes.
