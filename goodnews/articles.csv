New Pacemaker Developed that Uses the Heartbeat to Recharge its Battery,"By generating electrical energy from the heartbeat, a new pacemaker developed by scientists in Seattle was able to partially recharge itself.,Although the beat only generated 10% of the energy needed for the next heartbeat, the researchers hope that their breakthrough will become the standard, since changing a battery in a wireless pacemaker requires heart surgery, convincing most people to just implant a second one.,The new device is much smaller than a traditional pacemaker due to its wireless nature, measuring about one-third the size of a AAA battery and residing entirely in the heart’s right ventricle.,“We hope to prolong battery life further and expand access of this product to younger patients, who would hopefully require fewer implants over their lifetime,” said Dr. Babak Nazer of the University of Washington in Seattle, who led the , demonstrating his team’s new invention.,“When we can improve upon our 10 percent harvesting efficiency, we hope to partner with one of the major pacemaker companies to incorporate our design and housing into an existing leadless pacemaker,” he added.,By converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, the experimental wireless pacemaker housing is able to partially recharge its battery—the same technology used in some,.,“Just like ultrasound converts electrical voltage into pressure or sound, we can engineer similar materials onto implantable medical devices to convert the heart’s natural oscillating pressures ‘backward’ into voltage to prolong battery life,” Dr. Nazer added.,Up until this point, wireless pacemakers have been impractical, as it is difficult to replace the battery, often leading to patients just having another one put in next to it.,Traditional pacemakers have tiny wires that connect the heart the a generator and battery, just under the skin of the left shoulder. A typical battery in both traditional and wireless pacemakers lasts 6 to 15 years.,As Nazer pointed out, younger patients with heart complications may require multiple pacemakers throughout their lives, making all options impractical for different reasons.,Part of his and his team’s next step will be to design long-term trials with real humans to make sure the device works properly. All the while they hope to increase the recharge rate for the battery. If 10% could become 20 to 30%, it could increase the functional life of the pacemaker by a not insignificant number of years."
"Since Pandemic Closed His Business, New Jersey Man Has Made Over 500 Shopping Trips For Seniors","The owner of a New Jersey frame shop has been unable to operate his business since late March.

Genius UK Business Uses Christmas Trees to Protect the Region From Flooding,"In an effort to combat flooding, a Yorkshire woman realized that thousands of wasted Christmas trees every year could be used as natural flood protection, and started a unique business to do just that.,The , delivers a potted Christmas fir, pine, or spruce to a family for the festive season. When the lights are taken down, the company then collects their rentals and replants them to enjoy another growing season.,When the trees get too tall, they are placed on the slopes of the nearby Calder Valley as natural floodwater breaks.,The , that the towns of Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire have been inundated by serious floods 4 times in the last 15 years, with the most-recent one causing $180 million (£150 million) in damages.,Rooted founder Sara Tomkins established a Christmas tree plantation in the spring of 2020 with 400 trees. Dozens of those original 400 have now become too large for the average living room, and have been hauled off for planting in the upper parts of the Calder Valley to stop floodwaters running down into the two towns below.,What started as a sustainability project turned into a flourishing commercial enterprise. When residents learned how their Christmas tree purchases could be used to protect their towns from floods and reduce waste from rotting trees, all of Tomkins’ original trees were rented out.,According to Tomkins, people pretend the trees are members of the family, and like to rent the same one over and over again to “watch them grow up with their kids.”,“It’s like people adopt them,” she says. “They become part of the family. I’ve got a couple of people already asking if they can have the same tree again in 2023 and I’m trying to gently break it to them that it’s going to be nine foot by then so it won’t fit in their house.”,Tomkins feels that demand might be 3x her current supply, but as a music venue director, she does the job only in her off hours.,“I do this in my spare time so I don’t have the capacity or the physical space to make it any bigger,” she told The Times. “But the demand being there is such a positive thing because, if we can reduce how many Christmas trees we cut down, that is a massive environmental win.”"
"Entrepreneur Designs Shoes That Expand As Children Grow, Building Great Business (Watch)","FYI to the non-parents out there, it takes at least 15 pairs of shoes for a child to grow from a toddler to a teenager—that’s a lot of trips to the Footlocker.,Fortunately, an Indian entrepreneur from Pune has designed a line of shoes that slowly uncurl as the child ages, intuitively solving the problem and reducing unnecessary manufacturing waste.,Called ,, the shoes were designed by Satyajit Mittal and his childhood friend Krutika Lal. Their innovative knitted uppers are designed with all the qualities a parent would want their kids’ shoes to have—durability, flexibility, and washability.,“Children do not wear the right shoes for the first ten years of their lives,” Mittal, who designed the Aretto shoes with consultations with concerned childhood podiatrists,,“Between zero and three years of age, children’s feet size changes every three months, and you need roughly 15 sizes between zero and nine, before attaining final foot size at 13 years. We figured out the problem that while feet grow, their shoes do not.”,What the podiatrists explained to him was that children have a broader footprint than adults, due to their not having worn shoes for most of their lives like adults. Tens of thousands of nerve endings provide the feedback needed for children to understand how to use the miraculous musculature in their feet to walk and run.,Most infantile and childhood shoes don’t consider this, and based on the frequency at which parents need to buy new shoe sizes, proper foot function is probably never even taken into account, and the occasional stuffing of toddler feet into shoes too small or too large, can disrupt this critical muscle development.,“We wanted to give children the right fit for all cycles. We chose one shoe to cover three sizes that allow 18 mm growth. We took inspiration from how a flower blooms from the bud stage to the fully-flowered stage. The transition happens organically every day. We applied this concept to the shoe,” said Mittal.,“We started working on a shoe that flexes as per the feet. Simply put, as and when the feet grow either from the front or back or sideways, and when a child wears this shoe, it expands accordingly and takes the shape and contour of their feet. That’s why children feel comfortable wearing such shoes,” he adds.,The shoes are priced between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,600, ($22 – $31) and are available internationally as well, provided that international buyers have either an Indian bank, or Google Pay, Amazon Pay, or WhatsApp Pay.,The shoes are fairly new on the marketplace but have already generated 21 lakh, or Rs 2.1 million ($25,000) in revenue."
"3 Cooks in Prison Honed Creativity with Drab Ingredients–Now Out, Award-Winning Chef And Businessmen","“There are geniuses in there,” said 2-time James Beard Award winner, Keith Corbin, referring to incarcerated men and their ability to cook with the most lifeless, flavorless ingredients imaginable.,Corbin spent 10 years in prison himself, and combined with his career as an award-winning chef at his restaurant Alta Adams, he knows what it takes to make good food out of anything.,Corbin was profiled in, that twisted together the stories of several entrepreneurs who launched careers in the food industry after more than a decade of smoking sausages in a toilet with toilet paper, or making tamal dough with ground-up Fritos.,Another of the featured ex-cons was Chef Michael Carter, executive at Down North Pizza in Philidelphia where he employs only formerly incarcerated men, or ,, and offers them half-way or low-income housing with the apartment building located above his pizza shop.,His pies, mostly square ones, have made the New York Times best pizza list, and won the Best of Philly 2021 category for square pie.,After Carter was released from a 12-year sentence, he took a class for resume writing for food professionals and was asked what experience he had. He replied he had cooked in prison for 2,000—he got a job the next week.,“The mission is actually what made me accept the job,” Carter said, “to be able to have a voice and tell people about the plight in our community of returning citizens.”,It’s something that both Carter and Corbin reported to Sonya Singh at the Guardian—that prison squeezes men, and that squeeze sometimes creates diamonds.,“You have people in there that literally never went to school for technology, but the phone breaks and they’ll figure out how to fix the motherboard,” Corbin said. “There’s geniuses in there, ingenuity.”,Corbin, on the other hand, went into prison with a deep connection to food. His grandmother grew tomatoes and collard greens in their yard, and would wake up at 5 a.m. to start cooking for the working people in her community.,In prison, Corbin also fed dozens of people, often with flavorless ingredients. At the commissary, he could requisition packaged food items and try and do his best to squeeze flavor into dishes. He told Singh that he made a Reece’s Peanut Butter Cup by baking syrup-soaked processed peanuts and melting a Hershey’s bar overtop.,The appreciation he got for that particular experiment gave him belief and determination. He would see, Singh wrote in her feature, the Asian inmates fermenting their own kimchi, further expanding his understanding of possibilities in an environment that seems on the surface a largely possibility-less one.,Corbin’s , serves a food born of those two worlds—5 a.m. in his grandmother’s kitchen, and 5 p.m. at a California correctional facility. He calls it “California soul.”,At Down North, Carter’s for-profit yet mission-driven restaurant hires returning citizens at $15 per hour, double the state’s minimum wage, and about $3 above the norm for starting restaurant workers.,He and Corbin, along with another food service entrepreneur profiled in the piece, all agreed that re-entry skills are not taught in prison, but that any entrepreneur in hospitality and food service with two brain cells to rub together should set up an interview booth in front of the nearest halfway house, because the desire to work hard and make a decent living if given a chance burns white hot in returning citizens.,That last entrepreneur, Chef Sharon Richardson, spent 20 years in prison in New York but now runs Just Soul Catering, which employs only formerly incarcerated women, and,, a non-profit that helps formerly incarcerated women with histories of domestic violence achieve their goals, become leaders, and rebuild their lives. They offer a food service fellowship program for women.,For Richardson, food service was a healing event in prison, and highlighted one story in particular when the women in her block stayed up late to cook for her after her mother died of a stroke.,You can read the ,."
Three-Quarters of Small Business Owners Believe They’re Equipped to Handle Any Economic Instability,"More than three quarters of U.S. small business owners believe that their company is equipped to handle any upcoming economic instability, according to a new poll.,The new survey of 1,000 small business owners revealed that increased interest rates and inflation are their top economic concerns for the remainder of 2023.,But despite those economic concerns, 72% of small business owners feel more optimistic now about the financial prospects of their company than they did at the beginning of the year.,The entrepreneurs have tapped into various financial resources to cope with the economic changes, including savings accounts and loans (61%) and raising prices (50%).,Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of ,, the random double-opt-in survey found that 48% of those surveyed (which included a statistically significant amount of African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and women small business owners) have raised their prices by an average of 7% over the last six months.,But they are still reporting an increase in repeat business (66%), sales (63%) and number of new clients (56%).,: ,Having an online presence is more important to small businesses than it used to be, which led to some of the changes made this year: 66% of respondents have increased their advertising and marketing efforts, 58% increased their digital presence, and more than half started selling products online.,“Small businesses are the foundation of the economy,” said Tomer Barel, Melio’s president and COO. “And, despite the challenges posed by inflation and interest rates, small business owners seem to adapt and demonstrate impressive agility and resilience.”,Beyond the importance of digitizing aspects of their businesses—like, inventory management (51%) and customer service (42%)—three-quarters feel that it is most imperative to accept forms of payment beyond cash—more than it used to be.,: ,“Since the pandemic began over three years ago, small businesses are embracing new technologies that can help them take control over their finances and weather economic uncertainty,” said Melio’s CBO Prashant Gandhi."
Small Business to Sell ‘Superplants’ to Remove 30x More Indoor Pollutants Than Normal Houseplants,"A company in France has developed genetically-enhanced houseplants that remove 30 times more indoor air pollutants than your normal ficus.,Paint, treated wood, ,, insulation, unseen mold—there is a shopping list of things that can fill the air you breathe in your home with VOCs or volatile organic compounds. These include formaldehyde and other airborne substances that can cause inflammation and irritation in the body.,The best way to tackle this little-discussed private health problem is by keeping good outdoor airflow into your living spaces, but in the dog days of summer or the depths of a Maine winter, that might not be possible.,Houseplants can remove these pollutants from the air, and so the company Neoplants decided to make simple alterations to these species’ genetic makeup to supercharge this cleaning ability.,In particular, houseplants’ natural ability to absorb pollutants like formaldehyde relies on them storing them as toxins to be excreted later.,French scientists and Neoplants’ co-founders Lionel Mora and Patrick Torbey engineered a houseplant , to plant matter. They also took aim at the natural microbiome of houseplants to enhance their ability to absorb and process VOCs as well.,The company’s first offering—the Neo P1—is a Devil’s ivy plant that sits on a custom-designed tall stand that both maximizes its air-cleaning properties and allows it to be watered far less often.,Initial testing, conducted by the Ecole Mines-Telecom of Lille University, shows that if you do choose to shell out ,, it’s as if you were buying 30 houseplants. Of course, if you went for the budget route of 30 houseplants, you’d have to water them all.,The founders pointed out in an interview done with Forbes last year that once they settled on the species and fixed the winning genetic phenotype, the next part of the process was just raising plants, the same activity done in every nursery and florist in every town in Europe.,Deliveries for the P1 are estimated for August 2024."
El Diseñador de Nueva Zelanda Crea un Ingenioso Tragaluz con Energía Solar que Desaliniza el Agua para Beber,"Las personas que viven en los barrios marginales de la costa de Chile tienen toda el agua que podrían necesitar, pero no pueden beberla porque es demasiado salada. También hay abundante energía solar aquí, pero nada para aprovecharla.,Ahora, un finalista del Lexus Design Award 2021, ,, ha creado algo que aprovecha estos dos abundantes recursos: un dispositivo de iluminación con energía solar que desaliniza el agua.,El agua potable es escasa para las 110.000 familias de la zona y la energía llega a través de líneas eléctricas poco fiables. Las ventanas a menudo están tapiadas para aumentar la privacidad y la seguridad, lo que elimina casi toda la luz natural.,“Quería lograr un diseño que fuera sostenible, pasivo y creara una característica sorprendente dentro de la casa del asentamiento oscuro”, , Goglau, un neozelandés que se graduó de la Real Academia Danesa con una maestría, especializado en arquitectura para condiciones extremas.,“En mi proceso de desarrollo, se hizo evidente que podía abordar la falta de iluminación interior y acceso al agua mediante la creación de un tragaluz híbrido y un dispositivo de desalinización solar”.,El dispositivo de Goglau puede purificar 440 mililitros de agua al día, y la salmuera sobrante se tamiza en baterías hechas de zinc y cobre donde alimentan una tira de LED para usar durante la noche.,Durante el día, la luz funciona con un pequeño panel solar, y todo es barato de fabricar.,No solo se enfoca en la función, sino que el tragaluz de desalinización solar también se modela de tal manera que utiliza el proceso químico de evaporación y condensación para crear patrones de iluminación relajantes en las paredes y el piso a medida que los fotones se mueven a través de gotas de agua, vapor y ondulaciones. en la sombra estilizada.,: ,Empleado ahora como arquitecto en GXN, Goglau no sabe si ganará el premio Lexus, como uno de los seis finalistas, pero su invento, con la ayuda de organizaciones benéficas locales, , entre los hogares informales de la ciudad chilena. de Antofagasta.,(, el video sobre este tragaluz a continuación…)"

Mira Mil Millones de Años de Movimiento de Placas Tectónicas Formando Nuestros Continentes en 40 Segundos,"Mil millones de años de movimientos geológicos de la Tierra se han resumido en un video de 40 segundos, en el que los continentes y océanos revolotean como mariposas amorosas mientras demuestran cuán móvil es realmente la superficie de la Tierra.,La historia de la tectónica de placas, el deslizamiento y deslizamiento de la corteza terrestre y los continentes, ha tenido lugar durante miles de millones de años a velocidades entre la tasa de crecimiento de las uñas (40 mm por año) y del cabello (160 mm por año).,El , demuestra no sólo cuánto se suman los milímetros con el tiempo, sino que retrata una teoría en la evolución de la Tierra, desde el período supercontinente de Gondwana hace 540 a 320 millones de años, hasta la configuración moderna, el Aparente Polar Wander, en el que la mayoría las masas de tierra se han arrastrado hacia el Polo Sur antes de condensarse en un punto central y volver a subir juntas como si fueran forzadas a través de un embudo.,El coautor del ,, el Dr. Michael Tetley de la Universidad de Sydney, dijo a Euronews: “Por primera vez se ha construido un modelo completo de tectónica, incluidos todos los límites”.,“En una escala de tiempo humana, las cosas se mueven en centímetros por año, pero como podemos ver en la animación, los continentes han estado en todas partes en el tiempo. Un lugar como la Antártida que hoy vemos como un lugar frío, helado e inhóspito, en realidad alguna vez fue un buen destino de vacaciones en el ecuador”, agregó.,La teoría principal que explica el desplazamiento de estos continentes es que, como una tapa de alcantarilla flotando sobre un torrente de agua en una calle inundada, la corteza terrestre es mucho más rígida y tiene más resistencia mecánica que la astenosfera debajo de ella.,A medida que la roca caliente y quebradiza se desplaza en la astenosfera más débil, su movimiento a través de la parte inferior de la litosfera crea una presión que hace que esta última se mueva. A medida que las placas tectónicas que forman la litosfera se mueven, el desgarro indiscriminado y el choque entre sí crean algunas de las características más dramáticas de nuestro planeta, como cadenas montañosas, volcanes, trincheras y plataformas submarinas e incluso océanos.,: ,El coautor, el Dr. Sabin de la Universidad de Sydney, dijo en un ,: “El planeta Tierra es increíblemente dinámico, con la superficie compuesta de ‘placas’ que constantemente se empujan entre sí de una manera única entre los planetas rocosos conocidos. Estas placas se mueven a la velocidad de crecimiento de las uñas, pero cuando mil millones de años se condensan en 40 segundos, se revela una danza fascinante”.,“Los océanos se abren y se cierran, los continentes se dispersan y se recombinan periódicamente para formar inmensos supercontinentes”, añade.,Zahirovic y sus compañeros de equipo esperan que el modelo que han creado ayude a los científicos planetarios en todo tipo de investigación, desde predecir dónde se producirá el aumento del nivel del mar con mayor fuerza hasta predecir dónde se pueden encontrar grandes depósitos de cobre.,(, las placas en movimiento en el video de EarthByte.), "
Las Playas han Visto un Incremento Enorme en Anidación de Tortugas Laúd Después de las Restricciones a los Turistas en Tailandia y Florida,"Desde peces volviendo a los canales de Venecia hasta venados en las calles de Londres, muchas de las órdenes de aislamiento y restricciones sociales como medidas de prevención ante el coronavirus han permitido a la naturaleza volver a los lugares menos esperados.,Tailandia es la nación más reciente en ocupar los titulares ante este fenómeno, después de que el gobierno de dicho país puso restricciones a los vuelos internacionales y varias medidas para que los ciudadanos se mantuvieran en sus hogares.,Aunque el virus ha afectado la economía turística de Tailandia, en 2020 surgió una época de paz y salvación para las tortugas laúd. Una especie en peligro de extinción en el sudeste asiático, comenzaron a anidar allí por primera vez en cinco años.,Son la especie de tortugas marinas más grandes, ahora las tortugas laúd tienen 11 nidos en las playas tailandesas, más de lo que se ha registrado en cualquier otra estación del año en las últimas dos décadas.,“Esta es una muy buena señal para nosotros, porque las tortugas tienen un alto riesgo de morir a causa de los artículos de pesca y de los humanos dañando las playas.” dijo el director del centro de Biología Marina de Phuket a The Guardian.,En Florida, el número de nidos de tortugas laúd ha incrementado dramáticamente desde el año pasado.,La playa Juno es la ubicación con mayor densidad de nidos en todo el mundo, con un estimado de 21,000 el año anterior, número que proviene de varias especies.,Con tan solo dos 2 semanas en la temporada de verano del anidación del 2020, personal del Centro de Vida Marina Loggerhead encontraron y delimitaron 76 lugares de anidación de tortugas laúd, un incremento significativo comparado con el año anterior en la longitud de 15.28km de playa.,Sin perros ni personas caminando cerca o sobre los nidos, exponiendo los huevos, hay una mayor oportunidad de que los huevos sobre vivan los 60 días antes de día del nacimiento.,“Nuestras tortugas laúd están viviendo con fuerza este año. Estamos emocionados de ver a nuestras tortugas prosperar en este medio ambiente,” le dijo Sarah Hirsch al noticiero WPEC-TV de West Palm Beach.,“Nuestro mundo a cambiado, pero estas tortugas han estado haciendo esto por millones de años y es reconfortante y nos esperanza ver como el mundo sigue.”,Para el final de la estación de anidamiento, si los números continúan incrementando, podría ser de gran ayuda para las especies vulnerables."
Un Mapa te Permite Ver Como tu Hogar se ha Movido por el Continente en estos 750 Millones de Años,"Un mapa interactivo en línea permite marcar la dirección de tu casa y superponer la geografía global de épocas pasadas para ver cómo ha cambiado la tierra durante 750 millones de años.,Ver los resultados puede ser muy sorprendente. Hace 600 millones de años, por ejemplo, cuando la vida multicelular recién comenzaba a emerger en el océano, la capital estadounidense de Washington DC se estrelló contra la costa de África occidental como parte de una bola de tierra desordenada que se extendía hasta el Polo Sur, lo que eventualmente se separan, se alejan y forman las Américas.,El proyecto, hecho con mucha dedicación por el paleontólogo Ian Webster, es una emocionante herramienta de mapas que permite a los usuarios ingresar a la mayoría de los pueblos, ciudades y países en una barra de búsqueda, donde , le mostrará aproximadamente dónde se encontraba la tierra a lo largo de 750 millones de años calendario.,El proyecto está adjunto a la , más grande del mundo, también creada por Webster, quien se basó en datos geográficos de otro recurso llamado Tierra Antigua (,). Creado por el paleógrafo Christopher Scotese, Ancient Earth fue la culminación de un trabajo de 30 años en desarrollo llamado Proyecto Mapas Paleo (Paleo Maps Project).,La página web se muestra con una variedad de herramientas que le permiten obtener información interesante o seleccionar un período de tiempo en función de la aparición de características específicas, como la primera flor que floreció en la Tierra.,Dado que Webster es un experto en dinosaurios, cualquier ubicación que ingrese en la función de búsqueda también le proporcionará una lista de dinosaurios que habrían sido sus vecinos, todos con enlaces en línea al perfil de ese dinosaurio en particular en la base de datos de Webster; en general, representa un recurso educativo increíble para niños y adultos interesados en la paleontología o la geografía.,: ,Incluso con la tecnología GPS moderna y programas como Google Maps, los globos terráqueos y los mapas de papel bidimensionales siguen dando forma a nuestra percepción de la esfera que llamamos Tierra.,Un gran ejemplo de nuestra dependencia de los mapas es la palabra china para China: “Reino Medio”. Esta percepción de que China es el punto medio entre el cielo y la Tierra se refleja en los mapas chinos, donde es el Océano Pacífico el que ocupa las áreas centrales de la derecha en lugar del Atlántico, y donde Asia y África obstruyen el lado izquierdo con los otros continentes situados a la derecha.,Otro ejemplo se puede encontrar en mapas fechados en la década de 1980 o antes, cuando dada la importancia del hemisferio norte para la mayoría de los estudiosos, el ecuador se colocó a 10 grados de longitud norte, haciendo que los continentes del hemisferio sur parecieran más pequeños.,Ancient Earth es lo último en herramientas educativas que cambian de perspectiva, especialmente para los niños, ya que pueden ver cómo sus propios hogares se mueven en la danza tectónica que ha estado ocurriendo durante miles de millones de años.,“Me sorprende que los geólogos recopilaran datos suficientes para trazar mi casa hace 750 [millones] de años, así que pensé que todos ustedes también lo disfrutarían”, escribió Webster en un comentario para ,.,“Obviamente, nunca podremos demostrar la exactitud”, concluye Webster. “En mis pruebas encontré que los resultados del modelo pueden variar significativamente. Elegí este modelo en particular porque es ampliamente citado y cubre la mayor cantidad de tiempo”."
Good Gardening—A New Year: What Have You Got in the Ground?,"Welcome back to Good Gardening! Last week most of our Good Gardeners were lying dormant still, and didn’t have anything so far to share. Perhaps on the cusp of May, there will be news and pictures—or at least we can start with mine.,Since our last post, my garden has sprung to life thanks to a mild Italian winter. I took a chance to start a bit early, which is why the tomato plant in the central frame is as tall as it is (my grandmother told me it was doomed).,In the left frame one can see a line of yellow bell peppers, and on the right, the sown carrots beginning to emerge from their thick winter mulch. The flowers in the middle are calendula, which I also started early to build as deep a root system as possible to survive the summer.,I also planted a Japanese maple to commemorate the birth of my son, Harrison, on April 13th. I had to make the difficult choice between a rising maple and a spreading maple, but unlike what I remember from living in the US, here in Italy, the rising maple is quite popular, and I liked the idea of saving space along the ground. I covered the upturned soil in moss, watered it, and covered it with leaves because the birds rip up the moss I plant., , , ,Question 1: How did you prepare your garden for the growing season?,Question 2: What have you got peeking out of the soil so far?,Question 3: Do you like to start things inside early or sow directly?"

"New Species of Mosasaur Discovered–Proves Key Fossil Link, Named for Mythical Norse Serpent","In Norse Mythology 101, there would certainly be a section on the Midgard Serpent, known as Jormungandr, which encircles the Earth and holds up the oceans by fitting its tail in its mouth.,It was in honor of that mythical beast that a new species of Mosasaur, a huge and terrifying ancient marine reptile, entered a key place in the fossil record as ,This new species has traits similar to two widely found and well-researched Mosasaurid genera, one of which, , lived in the early Cretaceous and grew to lengths between 6 and 14 feet, while the second, ,grew to be about 40 feet longer than that, and lived in the late Cretaceous.,Norse mythology enthusiasts will note that the species name, ,sounds conspicuously like Valhalla, the great hall of Odin where half of all fallen warriors go to dwell. In reality, it’s named after the town in North Dakota where the fossil was discovered.,The fossil itself is an impressive specimen consisting of a nearly complete skull, jaws, and spine.,“If you put flippers on a Komodo dragon and made it really big, that’s basically what it would have looked like,” , the study’s lead author Amelia Zietlow, a Ph.D. student in comparative biology at the American Museum of Natural History.,They have been found fossilized on all 7 continents owing to their dominant position in the food chain and ocean-going lifestyle., is estimated to be about 24 feet long and, the new study suggests, lived around 80 million years ago. A set of bony ridges above its eye sockets stand out as a unique feature, and would have given it a rather permanent scowl.,“As these animals evolved into these giant sea monsters, they were constantly making changes,” Zietlow said. “This work gets us one step closer to understanding how all these different forms are related to one another.”,A fair few questions about those changes remain unanswered, such as when and how many separate times they evolved flippers, when their early ancestors went from semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, and if they were more closely related to snakes or monitor lizards."
He Found His Dad’s 1930s Car at An Auction–and Got it Working Again (LOOK),"A man found his father’s beloved old yellow car from the 1930s going up in an auction, and with his son’s help bought and restored it over the course of the pandemic, reuniting their family with a rare and treasured heirloom.,Every family has its stories—the ones heard around the dinner table a hundred times—and for the Sterns of England it was about Grandad’s bright yellow Talbot-Darracq motor car.,Bought in 1935, proud Alec Stern, a Londoner who made his bones parking cars in a city garage, used to drive his wee son Malcolm around town whilst reveling in the long, sloping fenders, chrome grill, and banana yellow bodywork.,Then in World War II, when the British Government ordered the evacuation of children to the countryside, young Malcolm Stern remembers being driven away on a coach watching his dad follow along behind in his Talbot-Darracq.,And that was it for the story of Alec and his yellow car, who sold it in 1942.,Fast forward to 2020 and Malcolm was 91 years old looking for a new hobby when he decided to buy a 3D printer to make small models. That’s when he got the idea to make one of his father’s Talbot-Darracq; a grand idea, but he needed to understand the dimensions of the real thing before he could scale it down.,It only took a few clicks and keystrokes on the computer for Malcolm to locate his father’s actual car—plate numbers and everything—because it was being auctioned.,“An amazing story of serendipity,” Malcolm’s son Jonathan,. “To find the car by just coincidence. We were egging each other on, ‘Oh Dad, you’ve got to buy it…'” he remembers saying. “‘You can’t let it go again.’”,The cost was £8,000, or just over ten grand, a price indicative of fortune since Jonathan was able to afford it; but being of an age quite similar to Malcolm, it was in bad need of repairs before hitting the road.,Jonathan was at first doubtful that his father was up to the manual labor required to refurbish the car, but in Malcolm’s garage in Rickmansworth, a British town north of London, he launched a 3-year project, hiring professionals when he needed to, doing everything else himself, and even using the 3D printer which would have otherwise almost certainly become a coat rack in the face of the restoration of the Talbot-Darracq.,Then the day came, 3 years after repairs first started, and with Malcolm (and the car) 3 years older, when the engine groaned to life, and even though the nonagenarian struggled with the heavy steering and ancient transmission, Malcolm and his son rumbled 15 miles to the parking lot of a local watering hole where a gathering of vintage car enthusiasts were meeting.,Arriving in the Talbot-Darrcq with a fresh coat of canary yellow paint, those gathered were in awe of the old man and the old car.,“The two of us, I think our faces hurt from smiling so much,” Jonathan said. “He [Malcolm] was the star of the show. Ninety-four years old, driving around this great big yellow car.”"
‘Healthy Food’ Isn’t Always Healthy for All: Learn Valuable Info About Your Gut Microbiome With Home Test Kit,"SPONSORED CONTENT,Are tomatoes healthy? Avocados? Nuts? According to Viome, a health tech company, there is no such thing as a universally-healthy food: What’s healthy for one person can be inflammatory for another.,With the rise of chronic disease worldwide, it was clear to company founder Naveen Jain that disease was a problem worth tackling through prevention. He assembled a team of scientists to launch a company that can analyze your gut to understand what is causing inflammation, which is the root cause of many chronic illnesses—as well as symptoms like bloating, sleeplessness, skin problems, stomach troubles, a lack of energy, sore joints, and more.,Viome can identify—from ,—what is actually happening in your body and what foods and supplements you need to help you function at peak performance.,The company uses a high-resolution technology called meta-transcriptome sequencing to identify all the microorganisms living in your gut, from bacteria and viruses to fungi, yeast, parasites and bacteriophages. With this data, Viome recommends which foods and supplements can help you to reach optimal microbial function.,You might have been advised to eat your greens, and that greens and nuts are anti-inflammatory. The data shows this isn’t always true.,Spinach, bran, rhubarb, beets, nuts and nut butters all contain Oxalates. We now know that Oxalate-containing food can be harmful, unless you have the microbes present that can metabolize it into a non-harmful substance. 30% of the 5300,000 Viome customers analyzed so far actually lack the microbes to metabolize oxalates properly. In other words, “healthy foods” like spinach are actually not healthy for these people.,Paleo, Keto, and high-performance diets include a lot of protein which helps build muscle and provide energy, but if some people eat too much, it can cause inflammation and decrease longevity.,Viome analyzes your microbiome to determine whether you are eating too much protein that feeds protein-fermenting bacteria like Alistipes putredinis and Tanneralla forsythia, and whether these organisms are producing harmful substances such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, p-cresol, or putrescine, which can damage your gut lining.,Choline in certain foods can get converted by bacteria into trimethylamine (TMA), which is associated with heart disease when it gets absorbed into your body and converted to TMAO. TMA conversion doesn’t happen in individuals unless they have the appropriate bacteria in their microbiome. Again, Viome can see the TMA production, and many of the gamma-proteobacteria that do this conversion.,What foods contain choline? Liver, salmon, chickpeas, split peas, eggs, navy beans, and peanuts are a small sample. Before you decide to go full-on pescatarian or paleo, you may want to check if your microbiome is producing TMA with that salmon or steak.,Minerals like iron in your food can, in certain inflammatory microbial environments, promote growth of pathogens like Esherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella. On the other hand, when you don’t get enough iron, you could become anemic, leading to weakness and shortness of breath. , can reveal if you should be staying away from these iron-rich foods.,Our gut and brain are connected via the vagus nerve. A large majority of neurotransmitters are also interconnected with our microbiome. Surprisingly, 90% of all serotonin (a feel-good neurotransmitter) is produced by your gut microbiome, not by your brain.,When you have a maladjusted microbiome that’s producing a large amount of toxins like hydrogen sulfide, the lining of your gut starts to deteriorate into what’s known as ‘leaky gut’. This causes low-grade chronic inflammation, which has been identified as a potential source of depression or higher levels of anxiety, in addition to many other chronic diseases.,The microbiome is responsible for calorie extraction, which creates energy, through pathways such as the Tricarboxylic acid cycle. Our bodies depend on the energy that our gut produces.,Efficient high-performing microbiomes are excellent for athletes who need extra energy, but suboptimal for those with sedentary lifestyles. And if the microbes can’t or won’t metabolize the glucose (sugar) that you eat, it will be stored as fat.,Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a pro-inflammatory molecule made by some of your microbes. Too much LPS can wreak havoc on your immune system and put it into overdrive. When your immune system is overactive, your joints and other body parts often suffer collateral damage from inflammation.,Your microbiome may be making you feel older because it keeps giving warnings to your immune system, ultimately leading to chronic pain. If you have a condition ending in “-itis,” it’s possible that when you balance your microbiome, the inflammation from your “-itis” will be reduced.,The acid in your stomach protects you from the bacteria in your mouth and the parasites and fungi in your food. When you have low stomach acid, bacteria from your mouth makes it down to your GI tract, an invasion associated with autoimmune disease and inflammation.,We’re beginning to learn that low stomach acid is perhaps one of the major causes of chronic disease. What kinds of things cause low stomach acid? Stress and antacids like Nexium and Prilosec.,As long as your microbiome is up to the task, carbs aren’t bad. The key is whether your microbiome can transform the starches you eat into amino acids. Your microbiome comprises 20% of your Branch Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs), and it will adapt to make these vital BCAAs in almost any way it can, based on your diet.,Prioritizing the health of your microbiome is essential. And Viome can help you get started to restore your gut microbiome and overall health.
